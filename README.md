# daq-software-switching

This repository contains software developed during my PhD in the ICE-DIP project (http://openlab.web.cern.ch/ice-dip). 
This software was used to evaluate software-switching and software-defined networking for next generation data acquistion
networks.

Contents
--------
1. daqswitch: Software switch for data acquisition. Proof of concept for evaluation.
2. odl: Python module and examples for OpenDaylight's northbound REST interface. Demonstrates prototype SDN data acquisiton network.
3. ovs: Patch for the Open vSwitch project adding optimizations specific to data acquisition.
4. tcp-static: Simple kernel module disabling TCP congestion control.
